      "description": "Accelerate GCS access using globally distributed caching infrastructure",
      "details": "Anywhere Cache is a built-in performance optimization in Google Cloud Storage that reduces latency and improves read speeds by serving frequently accessed objects from cache nodes located across Google’s global edge and regional network. This means users and applications can access data faster, regardless of their geographical location. Unlike traditional CDNs, Anywhere Cache is natively integrated into GCS and doesn’t require separate configuration. It’s ideal for media streaming, global machine learning pipelines, analytics dashboards, and gaming workloads. While it offers significant performance gains, it’s designed for read-heavy workloads and doesn't offer direct cache management.\nFor more details please refer to below link:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/anywhere-cache"
